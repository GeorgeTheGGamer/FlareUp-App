# FlareUp-App-

### Digital Onboarding Service
- Currently in the Onboarding Process to have full developer access to the NHS Website API instead of the limitations of Sandbox. This will allow me to display information on symptoms and treatments for the chosen Skin Condition. Getting this will be fully lisenced, credible and accurate information.

- Utilises the backend for external API Usage to limit API Calls 
- Caches the API Call so can use that if search again for the NHS   Information
